The table of results contains the text matched by the query, the contexts, the features
displayed in the central view but only for the matching part, the effective query, the document
and annotation set names. You can sort a table column by clicking on its header.
You can remove a result from the results table or open the document containing it by right-
clicking on a result in the results table.
ANNIC provides an Export button to export results into an HTML file. You can also select
then copy/paste the table in your word processor or spreadsheet.
A statistics tabbed pane is displayed at the bottom right. There is always a global statistics
pane that lists the count of the occurrences of all annotation types for the selected corpus
and annotation set. Double clicking on a row adds the annotation type to the query.
Statistics can be obtained for matched spans of the query in the results, with or without
contexts, just by annotation type, an annotation type + feature or an annotation type +
feature + value. A second pane contains the one item statistics that you can add by right-
clicking on a non empty annotation rectangle or on the first column of a row in the central
section. You can sort a table column by clicking on its header.
