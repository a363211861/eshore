China's national legislators Wednesday elected a presidium and set the agenda for the legislature's annual session, which is to open Thursday in Beijing.

A 172-member presidium was elected to take charge of the procedures of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC), which is scheduled to conclude on March 15, said Fu Ying, spokeswoman of the session, at a press conference.

Fu Ying, spokeswoman of the 12th National People's Congress met inquisitive journalists from home and abroad on Wednesday, a day before the legislature covenes in Beijing.

The NPC currently has 2,964 deputies, representing China's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions as well as Hong Kong, Macau and the military. According to a statement issued by the NPC Standing Committee on Tuesday the legislative body expelled 34 members due to corruption.

Responding to the deepening anti-graft blitz, this session has been marked by frugality, with hotels providing reusable toiletries for deputies and session organizers encouraging them to take digital versions of documents.

On the opening day Premier Li Keqiang will deliver a government report to the deputies, with economic reform likely on the agenda as the annual economic growth target is widely expected to be cut to around 7 percent, the lowest goal in 11 years and down from last year's target of 7.5 percent.
